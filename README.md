# Face-Detection-and-Recognition
Face Detection and Recognition app using python (openCV).
# Author: Walid Sharaiyra

# About:
I created this app using openCV from Python, which is a library of programming functions mainly for real-time computer vision. Originally developed by Intel, provides a real-time optimized Computer Vision library, tools, and hardware. It also supports model execution for Machine Learning (ML).

This app detects and recognizes faces of humans, trained by a set of pre-stored images in the /images folder.

Hope you like it!
